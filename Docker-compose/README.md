## Instructions:
Save the above content into a file named `docker-compose.yml`.

* Create directories for Airflow DAGs, logs, and plugins:
```bash
mkdir -p ./dags  ./plugins ./logs./config
```

* Generate a Fernet key for Airflow and replace `''` in the `AIRFLOW__CORE__FERNET_KEY` environment variable:
```bash
python3 -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
```

* Run the Docker Compose setup:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

This setup will bring up the services and initialize the Airflow database. You can access the Airflow web interface at http://localhost:8080 with the username airflow and password airflow. Let me know if you need any further instructions!
